<h2 id="Insights"></h2>
          <p>In the book BORN A CRIME ,Patricia Trevors mother is judged by the society to be prostitute by having arelationship <br>with a white man and producing a child.This was considered unlawful and abuse of African culture because<br> they were not allowed to interact with whites.Such segregation still happens in our society today where one <br>tribe is not allowed to marry from another tribe, a man being allowed to also marry from a foreign country.
          <br>This judgement of the society has made many young girls and women ending up in forced and unpeaceful marriages,<br> others have commited suicide to escape such harrasement from the society.In the book mans search for a living, <br>Frankl wrote, “Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of human freedoms to choose one's <br>attitude in any given set of circumstances,to choose one's own way.” The search for meaning, Frankl believed, <br>is the primary motivational factor of humans. Therefore there is always a point for breakthrough in life nomatter the situation<br>
