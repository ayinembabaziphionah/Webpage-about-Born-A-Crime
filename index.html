<h2 id="Insights"></h2>
          <p>In the book BORN A CRIME ,Patricia Trevors mother is judged by the society to be prostitute by having a relationship with a white man and producing a child. This was considered unlawful and abuse of African culture because they were not allowed to interact with whites. Such segregation still happens in our society today where one tribe is not allowed to marry from another tribe, or a man being allowed to also marry from a foreign country.
          This judgement of the society has made many young girls and women ending up in forced and unpeaceful marriages, others have commited suicide to escape such harrasement from the society.
          <p>In the book mans search for a living, Frankl wrote, “Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of human freedoms—to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.” The search for meaning, Frankl believed, is the primary motivational factor of humans. Therefore there is always a point for breakthrough in life nomatter the situation</p>

   <p>Education was one of the new cultures introduced by the colonialists but impacted  Africans in a  positive way, education impacted the lives of people by reducing their illiteracy and stopped their old lifestyle of not going to school to earn knowledge. This helped them a lot to acquire top-ranked jobs unlike before where they only relied on low jobs due to lack of skills and knowledge. </p>
